# Java_Database_Ticketing_Booking

A ticket reservation program that handles the seating of people attending an event. 

The program allows the user to perform the following options:\
a.	Reserve a seat for an attendee\
b.	Update status of a seat reservation\
c.	Show attendance report

When reserving a seat for an attendee, the program obtains the name of the attendee and price paid for the event. The program then asks for the seat location (seat location ranging from 101 to 199) for the attendee and reserves it for that person. The program does not allow reservations for multiple attendees to the same seat location.

When updating the status of a seat reservation, the program obtains the seat location to update from the user and then allows the status to change to either be Reserved, Seated, or Available.

For the attendance report, the program shows the following information:\
a.	Show seat locations that are Reserved, Seated, or Available and show the total count of seats that in each of these statuses (i.e. show many seats are Reserved, Seated, and Available)\
b.	If a seat is either Reserved or Seated, the report should also show all the information about the attendee for that seat\
c.	At the end of the report, show a total of seat prices paid for all attendees \
d. Show all attendants in order of highest price paid to lowest\
e.	Show all attendants by name in alphabetical order\
f.	Show a comparison of prices paid for seats the are Seated versus Reserved
